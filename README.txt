Changelog:

v1.3 (2011-08-18)
  - Made slide animation a continuous scroll effect, rather than jumping back to start/end
  - Cleaned up code and created better test cases for different slider scenarios. The slider is a lot more bulletproof as of this update.

v1.2 (2011-08-16)
  - Fixed some code redundancies
  - Added "randomize" property to randomize slide oder on pageLoad
  - Added "touchSwipe" property for swipe gestures on iOS and Android devices (no Android device to test this, but it should work)
  - Fixed minor bugs in jQuery 1.3.2 where navigation was not appending correctly
